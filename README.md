This daily planner will start by displaying your current date as well as working hour time slots where you can input tasks to be completed.
When the the current time has passed, any inputs will be grayed.
If it is the current hour for a task, the input will be highlighted red. 
If the task is for a future hour, the input will be highlighted green.

Once typing the task into your input, you are given the option to click save for that task. 
If saved, that task will continue to display for later use.
